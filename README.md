# Personal Blog â€” v1

In April 2018, I built a personal development blog focused on interactive widgets, adopting an "explorable explanation" style for blog posts.

I rebuilt the blog in early 2020 to attempt a more traditional blog format. Unfortunately, the new version is not yet open-source. It's tricky since I like the idea of the code being available, but I want to keep a lid on upcoming posts. There's also some backend code that I'd rather not release, since I'm not 100% confident it's secure ðŸ˜…. Finally, the codebase needs work, and I wouldn't want folks drawing inspiration from it, in its current state.

The good news is that in terms of its Gatsby architecture, it reuses a lot of stuff from this blog, so you can peruse the code here to get a pretty good idea of how it's built!
